Mojo üî• ‚Äî a new programming language for all developers, AI/ML scientists and software engineers.

A curated list of awesome Mojoüî• code, problem-solving, solution, and in future libraries, frameworks, software and
resources.

Let's accumulate here very new technology knowledge and best practices.

* [Awesome Mojoüî•](https://github.com/ego/awesome-mojo)
* [Mojo üî•Driven Community](https://mojo-lang.dev)
* [Official Mojo docs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)

Mojo is a programming language that combines the user-friendliness of Python with the performance capabilities of C++
and Rust. Additionally, Mojo enables users to harness the vast ecosystem of Python libraries.

In a brief

* Mojo allows you to leverage the entire Python ecosystem.
* Mojo is designed to become a superset of Python.
* Make Mojo compatible with existing Python programs.
* Mojo as a member of the Python family.
* Applied for AI systems and AI field.
* Scalable programming for heterogeneous systems.
* Building unify the world‚Äôs ML/AI infrastructure.
* Innovations in compiler internals.
* Support for current and emerging hardware accelerators.
* Systems programming features.
* Leverage the existing MLIR compiler ecosystem.

# Hello Mojoüî•

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research and production by combining the best of Python
syntax with systems programming and metaprogramming.

`hello.mojo` or `hello.üî•` the file extension can be an emoji!

You can read more about why Modular doing this [Why Mojoüî•](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html)

> What we wanted was an innovative and scalable programming model that could target accelerators and other heterogeneous
> systems that are pervasive in the AI field.
> ...
> Applied AI systems need to address all these issues, and we decided there was no reason it couldn‚Äôt be done with just
> one language. Thus, Mojo was born.

But Python has done its job very well =)

> We didn‚Äôt see any need to innovate in language syntax or community.
> So we chose to embrace the Python ecosystem because it is so widely used, it is loved by the AI ecosystem, and because
> we believe it is a really nice language.

Who knows these programming languages will be very happy, because Mojo benefits from tremendous lessons learned from
other languages Rust, Swift, Julia, Zig, Nim, etc.

* Rust starts the C revolution and now [Rust in the Linux kernel](https://docs.kernel.org/rust/index.html).
* [Swift](https://www.swift.org) makes [Apple beautiful](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) from a technical
  perspective.
* [Julia](https://julialang.org) high performance.
* [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) systems programming language.
* [Zig](https://ziglang.org) general-purpose programming language. We are like and following it =)

## Binary Search Algorithm

In computer science, [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), also known as
half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target
value within a sorted array.

Let's do some code with Python, Mojoüî•, Swift, V, Julia, Nim, Zig.

Note: For **Python** and **Mojo**, I leave some optimization and make the code similar for measurement and comparison.
