Mojo ðŸ”¥ â€” a new programming language for all developers, AI/ML scientists and software engineers.

A curated list of awesome MojoðŸ”¥ code, problem-solving, solution, and in future libraries, frameworks, software and
resources.

Let's accumulate here very new technology knowledge and best practices.

* [Awesome MojoðŸ”¥](https://github.com/ego/awesome-mojo)
* [Mojo ðŸ”¥Driven Community](https://mojo-lang.dev)
* [Official Mojo docs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)

Mojo is a programming language that combines the user-friendliness of Python with the performance capabilities of C++
and Rust. Additionally, Mojo enables users to harness the vast ecosystem of Python libraries.

In a brief

* Mojo allows you to leverage the entire Python ecosystem.
* Mojo is designed to become a superset of Python.
* Make Mojo compatible with existing Python programs.
* Mojo as a member of the Python family.
* Applied for AI systems and AI field.
* Scalable programming for heterogeneous systems.
* Building unify the worldâ€™s ML/AI infrastructure.
* Innovations in compiler internals.
* Support for current and emerging hardware accelerators.
* Systems programming features.
* Leverage the existing MLIR compiler ecosystem.

# Hello MojoðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research and production by combining the best of Python
syntax with systems programming and metaprogramming.

`hello.mojo` or `hello.ðŸ”¥` the file extension can be an emoji!

* [Hello Mojo ðŸ”¥](algorithm/HelloMojo.ðŸ”¥)

You can read more about why Modular doing this [Why MojoðŸ”¥](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html)

> What we wanted was an innovative and scalable programming model that could target accelerators and other heterogeneous
> systems that are pervasive in the AI field.
> ...
> Applied AI systems need to address all these issues, and we decided there was no reason it couldnâ€™t be done with just
> one language. Thus, Mojo was born.

But Python has done its job very well =)

> We didnâ€™t see any need to innovate in language syntax or community.
> So we chose to embrace the Python ecosystem because it is so widely used, it is loved by the AI ecosystem, and because
> we believe it is a really nice language.

Who knows these programming languages will be very happy, because Mojo benefits from tremendous lessons learned from
other languages Rust, Swift, Julia, Zig, Nim, etc.

* Rust starts the C revolution and now [Rust in the Linux kernel](https://docs.kernel.org/rust/index.html).
* [Swift](https://www.swift.org) makes [Apple beautiful](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) from a technical
  perspective.
* [Julia](https://julialang.org) high performance.
* [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) systems programming language.
* [Zig](https://ziglang.org) general-purpose programming language. We are like and following it =)

# Binary Search Algorithm

In computer science, [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), also known as
half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target
value within a sorted array.

Let's do some code with Python, MojoðŸ”¥, Swift, V, Julia, Nim, Zig.

Note:
For **Python** and **Mojo** versions,
I leave some optimization and make the code similar for measurement and comparison.

## [Python Binary Search](algorithm/binary_search_Python.py)

```python
from typing import List
import timeit

SIZE = 1000000
MAX_ITERS = 100
COLLECTION = tuple(i for i in range(SIZE))  # Make it aka at compile-time.


def python_binary_search(element: int, array: List[int]) -> int:
    start = 0
    stop = len(array) - 1
    while start <= stop:
        index = (start + stop) // 2
        pivot = array[index]
        if pivot == element:
            return index
        elif pivot > element:
            stop = index - 1
        elif pivot < element:
            start = index + 1
    return -1


def test_python_binary_search():
    _ = python_binary_search(SIZE - 1, COLLECTION)


print(
    "Average execution time of func in sec",
    timeit.timeit(lambda: test_python_binary_search(), number=MAX_ITERS),
)
```

## [MojoðŸ”¥ Binary Search](algorithm/BinarySearch_Mojo.mojo)

fn run_benchmark_sort() -> F64:
    fn _closure():
        var A = create_vertor()
        sort(A)
    return F64(Benchmark(NUM_WARMUP, MAX_ITERS).run[_closure]()) / 1e9

print(

    run_benchmark_sort(),
)
# Average execution time of MojoðŸ”¥ builtin `sort` in sec 2.988e-06
```

You can use it like:

```python
# Usage: merge_sort

var A = create_vertor()
merge_sort(A, 0, len(A)-1)

print(len(A))
print(A[0], A[99])
```

Builtin `from Sort import sort` a little bit faster than our implementation, but we can optimize it during deep in language
and as usual with algorithms =) and programming paradigms.

## Summary for sorting algorithms merge sort and quicksort

| Lang                | sec             |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Python merge_sort   | **0.019136679** |
| Python builtin sort | **0.000199228** |
| Mojo merge_sort     | **0.000011346** |
| Mojo builtin sort   | **0.000002988** |

Let's build a plot for this table.

```python
#%%python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

languages = ['Python merge_sort', 'Python builtin sort', 'Mojo merge_sort', 'Mojo builtin sort']
seconds = [0.019136679, 0.000199228, 0.000011346, 0.000002988]

# Apply a custom transformation to the values
transformed_seconds = [np.sqrt(1 / x) for x in seconds]

plt.barh(languages, transformed_seconds)
plt.xlabel('Custom Transformation')
plt.ylabel('Language and Sort Type')
plt.title('Comparison of Sorting Algorithms (Custom Transformation)')

plt.show()
```

Plot notes, more is better and faster.

# Programming manual

## `VariadicList` for destructuring/unpacking/accessing arguments

```python
from List import VariadicList

fn destructuring_arguments(*args: Int):
    let my_var_list = VariadicList(args)
    for i in range(len(my_var_list)):
        print("argument", i, ":", my_var_list[i])

destructuring_arguments(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

It is very useful for creating initial collections.
We can write like this:

```python
from Vector import DynamicVector
from StaticTuple import StaticTuple

fn create_vertor() -> DynamicVector[Int]:
    let st = StaticTuple[4, Int](1, 2, 3, 4)
    var v = DynamicVector[Int](st.__len__())
    for i in range(st.__len__()):
    v.push_back(st[i])
    return v

v = create_vertor()
print(v[0], v[3])

# or
from List import VariadicList

fn create_vertor() -> DynamicVector[Int]:
  let var_list = VariadicList(1, 2, 3, 4)
  var v = DynamicVector[Int](len(var_list))
  for i in range(len(var_list)):
    v.push_back(var_list[i])
  return v

v = create_vertor()
print(v[0], v[3])
```

## Strings

```python
from String import String
# String concatenation
print(String("'") + String(1) + "'\n")

# Python's join
print(String("|").join("a", "b", "c"))

# String format
from IO import _printf as print
let x: Int = 1
print("'%i'\n", x.value)
```

# The Zen of MojoðŸ”¥

# Space for improvements

It is my personal view, so don't judge me too harshly.

I can't say that MojoðŸ”¥ is an easy programming language for learning, like a Python as an example.

It requires a lot of understanding, patience and experience in any other programming languages.

If you want to build something not trivial, it will be hard but funny!

## Major things to improve:

1. Weak and unclear **documentation**.
2. Lack of **code examples**.
   A good example is [clojuredocs](https://clojuredocs.org) website.
3. More **explanation** to the language **paradigms**
4. Lack **comparison** to Python base things datatypes/functions/classes/expressions.
5. Even though Mojo is superset of Python, the **threshold** of language entry is **not so simple**.
6. A little bit raw, need some time for **stabilizing** language.
7. **Bugs**, like in any one.
8. Small **standard library**.
9. Project Jupyter and **notebooks environment**.
   I understand that Jupyter plugin and custom kernel are a good solution, but it is makes development so slow.
10. Not **open-sourced** yet.
   The community is waiting for open source compiler and REPL to start developing and producing libraries and applications.
   I think the community will easily rewrite the (bootstrapping) compiler from C++ to itself MojoðŸ”¥.

## Good and nice for win

1. **Modular team** easily responds to requests/questions/letters/ideas
2. **Friendly** and very smart **community**
3. **Problem-solving** programming language with an idea to not create new syntax but deal with real word challenges.
4. I don't know about you, but I was waiting and researching a long time for a MojoðŸ”¥.
   I have been tried a hundred of programming languages.
   The World is ready for the revolution and the future of computation and AI.
   I'm really into MojoðŸ”¥, it excites, fascinates me, and I hope it does the same for you.
5. I believe that a well-known distinguished leader Ph.D. Computer Science Chris Lattner can build things, systems, teams and change the future.
